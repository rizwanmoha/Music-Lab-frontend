            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <br />
        <h2>Is there TAB available for the song lessons if I become a Premium or Premium Plus subscriber?</h2>
        <p className='text-black'>Unfortunately, no. I am unable to provide a TAB for any song that is not in the public domain (ie. the composer of the work has been dead for at least 75 years). I am aware that many people on the internet, YouTube etc. provide TAB illegally, but I am not comfortable doing that. The videos do go slow enough that tabbing it out yourself for your own personal use as you follow along with the video should be easy. Plus, it has the added benefit of helping learn the music faster!</p> 

        <h2>What is Carl's musical education?</h2>
        <p className='text-black'>
            <p className='text-black'>I am a musical mutt. Besides having a slew of teachers when I was a kid in styles ranging from folk, rock, jazz and classical, I briefly attended a conservatory for classical guitar as a teen.</p>
            <p className='text-black'>I quickly decided it wasn't for me, so I instead started teaching privately at a local music store when I was 17. At this time I was also continuing my jazz studies privately with Greg Hyslop.</p>
            <p className='text-black'>Also, around this time (early to mid nineties), I studied musicianship training (theory and ear training) with the great Dick Grove until his passing in late '98. I credit Dick Grove with my ability to hear and understand music, he was truly a genius.</p>
            <p className='text-black'>I moved to Los Angeles in the summer 2000 and quickly sought out lessons with the great <u>Ted Greene</u>. His knowledge was so incredibly vast, it was an honor to be his student no matter how brief of a time it was.</p>
            <p className='text-black'>About that same time I dove deep back into my classical guitar studies in addition to studying composition and orchestration. I have studied classical guitar privately with Scott Tennant, Steven Thachuk, Gerald Klickstein and Aaron Shearer. My music composition and orchestration studies where under UCLA professors Dr. Steve Rothstein and Dr. Mark Carlson as well as composer Dr. Susan Hurley.</p>
            <p className='text-black'>Since 2015 I have studied the Equal Interval System of music composition under Emmy award winning composer <u>Glenn Jordan</u>.</p>

            <h2>If I need to cancel my monthly Premium or Premium Plus account, how do I do it?</h2>
            <p className='text-black'>
                <p className='text-black'>If you purchased your subscription through one of the app stores (ie.

The app stores are the ones that control your subscription and I can't control anything about your subscription from my end. If you purchased your subscription via the website, your cancellation process is as follows:</p>
                <p className='text-black'>1) If you have a monthly subscription using your Paypal account as the payment processor, <big>which only legacy accounts will have,</big> please cancel the monthly payments from within your own Paypal account. If you don't know how to do that, simply click <big>Contact</big> from the top navigation menu and let me know you would like to cancel. In your message, please include the email address that your Paypal subscription is under and I will cancel it from my side.</p>
                <p className='text-black'>2) If your payments are through our regular payment processor, and <big>NOT</big> Paypal, just follow the instructions below to cancel you recurring subscription.</p>
                <p>Once signed into your account, you can cancel your recurring subscription by clicking <big>My Account</big> from the top navigation menu.
